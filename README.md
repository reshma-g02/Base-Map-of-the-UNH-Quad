# Base-Map-of-the-UNH-Quad
This project demonstrates the fundamental process of creating a geological base map from scratch. By comparing "pace and compass" surveying with GPS waypoints, the study evaluates the accuracy of different field methods in plotting physical features like buildings and roads, highlighting the precision required for reliable geological orientation.
